# Real-time Motion-Based Obstacle Avoidance on the NVIDIA Isaac Sim Platform using CuRobo library

> ⚠️ This example is intended **solely for research purposes** and **not for commercial use**.

This is a example of hard real-time control protocol for the development of AI applications.
This demonstration showcases a hard real-time control protocol for the development of AI applications.
It illustrates how motion commands rapidly generated by CuRobo within Isaac Sim can be executed in high-frequency real-time cycles on a Doosan robot, enabling fast and responsive control.

## Prerequisites

- **1. Docker** is required for isaac container example.  
  [Docker Installation for Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)
  
- **2. Install for use in Isaac Sim** 
  https://curobo.org/get_started/1_install_instructions.html#install-for-use-in-isaac-sim

- **3. Install Doosan Robot Ros2 package** 
  https://github.com/DoosanRobotics/doosan-robot2


---

## Installation Steps
### 1. Install Isaac Sim + CuRobo in Docker
#### After building the emulator, use the provided script to build and launch the Isaac Sim + CuRobo container.
```bash
cd ~/doosan_curobo/docker
./build_and_start_docker.sh
```

### 2. Install Real-time Kernel for communication between Isaac Sim and doosanrobot (Another PC) 
####  This script connects the simulated robot to the real-time API using the Doosan control framework under hard real-time conditions. We recommend enabling the PREEMPT_RT kernel via Ubuntu Pro.




## How to Run

1. **(GPU PC)** Access the *Automatica 2025* container and run the `automatica2025_example` script:

```bash
docker exec -it automatica2025_container_isaac_sim_4.2.0 bash
omni_python automove.py
```

2. **(Real-time Kernel PC)** Inside the `sim2dr` directory, run the real-time API script:

```bash
cd sim2dr
./API_DRFL_ISAAC.sh
```
